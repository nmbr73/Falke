# Pimp the Falcon

Want to try your hand at editing stop-motion, but don't have the patience to shoot dozens of photos?
Want to show your post production skills? Any idea how to use some compositing and VFx to transform some simple photos into a cool clip?
Need some material to play with tracking, stabilization, colors, and all that good stuff?

Give it a try by using the shots in this repository (fork and clone or just [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/nmbr73/Falke/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.zip) if you are not comfortable with Git). Let me know the YouTube URL of the result so I can add it here (or add it yourself by submitting a pull request).

*Side note on the CC-BY-SA: Don't overdo it - no need to 'burn in' any attribution into your video (sure, you can do so - but it's not a must). Put a link into your video description and everything is fine.*

## nmbr73

This is my own - very simple - version created in DaVinci Resolve. No stabilization, no Fx - only some zoom and a little bit of 'Light Rays' at the end. But already pretty nice, isn't it? Any idea how to improve it?!? Show us how much better it can be done!

## MeinVideoStudio

A very helpful (German) tutorial by [MeinVideoStudio](https://www.youtube.com/c/MeinVideoStudio/videos) showing a ton of techniques to create a stunning Hyperlapse. Not a contribution to this repository in particular, but definitely worth watching - and containing our little [falcon at the end of the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebQ6DpyFU7Y&t=682s) it certainly deserves a place in our hall of fame.
